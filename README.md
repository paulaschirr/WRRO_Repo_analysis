# Library repositories in the UK

Data from IRUS (JISC) on research outputs stored in library repositories is analysed to explore their reach and impact. In this script, I develop several KPIs to compare downloads of outputs across repositories. Based on the number of downloads received one year after first download (to standardise download volume), I define output-type normalised top 10,25 and 50 percentiles to compare the impact of repositories. The script also analyses output type distribution and download origin to further explore the reach of library repositories.
